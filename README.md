# **🌱 Plant Disease Detection System for Sustainable Agriculture**  

## **📌 Overview**  
The **Plant Disease Detection System** is an AI-powered solution designed to help farmers detect plant diseases early, improve crop health, and promote sustainable agriculture. Using **Deep Learning, IoT, and Computer Vision**, this system accurately identifies plant diseases from leaf images and provides treatment recommendations. By integrating environmental sensor data, the system enhances disease prediction and minimizes excessive pesticide use, ensuring eco-friendly farming practices.  

This project aims to empower farmers, researchers, and agricultural policymakers with **real-time, data-driven insights** to prevent crop loss, optimize yield, and promote **sustainable food production** globally.
